# S4HANA

SAP4 HANA REST Connector

I would describe the value of this connector is in its simplicity. The question if the customer should use it depends on the usecases. If a customer decides he needs a simply API with the most basic usecases to access Business Partners data, he can use this connector. 
If the customer knows he will need more than the standard Business Partner values, and maybe he will use also other OData Rest Services from Microsoft, he should probably implement his own ODATA interface which will cost way more time but will be more powerful.

## Demo

Demo tries to connect to SAP and gets list of business partners

## Setup

Please set the global variables to the SAP needs. Maybe you need to add a certificate to connect to SAP via SSL.
